# DiscordWhitelist-Plugin

This plugin combines the whitelist of your Minecraft server with your Discord bot to easily whitelist users via your Discord server using a slash command. The whitelist requests must first be approved by moderators before they are actually whitelisted. The usernames with the Discord UserID are stored in a SQLite database as long as the user has not been removed. Once removed, the associated data will also be removed.
